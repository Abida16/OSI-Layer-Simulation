One of my ex-girlfriends once told me I was boring, and that hurt me. It hurt me right in the chest and in the stomach.

But, looking back now, I can see what she meant.

Because I always used to say "I don't mind."

I said it when it came to eating, when it came to going out, and even when it came to sex.

She just got more and more pissed off with me because I'd never make a decision. And then it seemed like she resigned herself to the fact that I'd never make a decision, and that's what made her bored of me.

Me being scared to make any kind of choice bored her.Me trying to be nice bored her.

Because I thought being "nice" meant always having to please the other person, and never making decisions that might annoy them, and always letting them choose everything.

That's not nice. That's weak. Though I suppose the word "nice" has origins in the words "ignorant" and "stupid" and "foolish."

Refusing to make decisions, being "nice," being weak.
